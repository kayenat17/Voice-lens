The purpose of this software is to create a document reader designed for 
visually impaired users. It combines OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to 
extract text from documents or images and TTS (Text-to-Speech) to convert the text into 
speech. The system aims to provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for 
converting printed or digital text into audio. It is a streamlit based webapp.
